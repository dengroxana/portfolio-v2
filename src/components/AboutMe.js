            <p>
              I am a detail-oriented <b>Front-End Developer</b> who previously
              served as a medical billing specialist in the healthcare industry.
              Whether de-bugging code or responding to complex insurance issues,
              I take a methodical, process-oriented approach in breaking down
              obscure problems into comprehensible solutions. I seek the
              opportunity to join a collaborative organization that places
              strong emphasis on mentorship so I can grow as both a developer
              and a professional.
